# Bayesian-Inference
Bayesian Data Analysis and Model Comparison 

The abstract was taken from the website Kaggle. I chose this specific problem because it provided me an opportunity to take an existing dataset and implement Bayesian Model Averaging (a Bayesian Approach) and compare it with different Bayesian models and also against the Multiple Regression Models calculated in the dataset.

I applied Multiple Linear Regression and Bayesian Linear Regression Techniques and compared the results.

I had two different data sets namely train dataset and test dataset. Both contained numerous variables in terms of features which were describing a house. The training dataset contained 1460 observations for which sale price of the house was provided. The test dataset contained 1459 observations for which the sale price needs to be predicted. 

Let's take a look at first few rows of the train dataset:
